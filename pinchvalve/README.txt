pinch_valve_pannel_ponoko.svg: this file is intended to be cut on a laser cutter
   (or outsourced to ponoko.com)  The parts it generates are intended to work with 
   "center adapter" and inplace of pincher, center cam, and face (ie do not print 
   these three)

valve_clip_x_yy: the number x_yy denotes a version of the clip with a x.yy milimeter 
   sized bump.  Choosing different sized parts allows you to adjust the pinchvalves
   closing force.  You should choose the smallest size clip that gets the job done
   without leaking to prevent premature failure of the silicone tube.

face.ad_prt, center_cam.ad_prt, & pincher.ad_prt: are only included as a reference 
   for the assembly drawing and should not be printed.
