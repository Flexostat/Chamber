What to print
-------------
Print 1 center_adapter.stl and one holder.stl per valve assembly (1 turbidostat
needs two assemblies)

Laser cut 1 P1-delrin laser parts-ponoko.eps: out of 4.9-5.1mm delrin sheet, which 
is enough for roughly 15 pinch valves.


notes
-----

P1-delrin laser parts-ponoko.eps: this file is intended to be cut on a laser cutter
   (or outsourced to ponoko.com, which this file is optimized for)  The parts it 
   generates are intended to work with "center adapter" and inplace of pincher, 
   center cam, and face (ie do not print these three)

valve_clip_x_yy: the number x_yy denotes a version of the clip with a x.yy milimeter 
   sized bump.  Choosing different sized parts allows you to adjust the pinchvalves
   closing force.  You should choose the smallest size clip that gets the job done
   without leaking to prevent premature failure of the silicone tube.

face.ad_prt, center_cam.ad_prt, & pincher.ad_prt: are only included as a reference 
   for the assembly drawing and should not be printed.
