Each directory contains the design source and binary (.stl .hex etc) needed to construct each part of the turbidostat.

All directories (where applicable) contain a source/ directory.  This directory contains the original design files for that component.  If you are not making a derivative design you may safely ignore these directories.

led_board/ and mainboard/ contain subdirectories called production_files.  These directories should be zipped as is and sent to PCB manufacturers.
